# PoC - Engagement Tracker

```text
# Folder structure

/backend
/frontend
/docs
```

Both `backend` and `frontend` folders are standalone applications that do not share anything in-between them.

This isn't the best practice, because I could've make this project a monorepo. But, for simplicity's & PoC's sake, I'm not using monorepo at the PoC stage.
